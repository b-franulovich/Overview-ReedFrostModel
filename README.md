# An Overview of the Reed-Frost Model - A Simple Epidemic Model

This paper is an exploration of the Reed-Frost Model which was developed in the 1920s by Lowell Reed and Hampton Wade Frost. It includes an in-depth overview and 
discussion of the model as well as deterministic and stochastic simulations, and parameter estimation.

The final project is written in LaTeX and utilizes R for the figures and plots, this can be found in the main.Rtex file.
The R Code used for the project can be found in the RCode_ReedFrost.R file.

The paper is organized into the following sections: Introduction & Background, Setup, Deterministic Model, Stochastic Model, Parameter Estimation, 
Conclusion, Appendix, and References.
